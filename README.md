# Birthday

A simple animation of a birthday cake. More animations to come.

Of course we could just store each of the frames as a separate text document
then display them all sequentially, but that would be much less fun!

This turned into more of an exercise of clever string manipulation.

## Why?

I turned 20 and was bored. I wrote this in like 20 minutes.
